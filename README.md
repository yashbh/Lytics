Analytics and Billing Application for Telecom
Technologies Used: PHP, HTML, CSS and MySQL, R and Materialise, Bootstrap.


Purpose of the project: The objective is to develop a web-app to manage billing and customer care activities of a Telecom company. It will be able to record information about the customers, send online bill to customers, online payment by customers, sending reminders regarding the payment of the bills and finding analytical trend in the usage of various products and services and using the so produced data to target some specific customers. By having this system, it will save money, help the company make better profits and increase the customer base. The main idea of the project is to provide better services to the customers by analyzing their past data and segment them to provide them the best offer according to their usage.
Customer clustering is the most important data mining methodologies used in marketing and customer relationship management. Customer clustering would use customer-usage data to track usage behaviour and create strategic business initiatives. Companies want to keep high-profit, high-value, and low-risk customers. A low-profit, high-value, and low-risk customer segment is also an attractive one, and the obvious goal here would be to increase profitability for this segment. Cross selling (selling new products) and up selling (selling more of what customers currently buy) to this segment are the marketing initiatives of choice.

### We finished PHP and MySQL implementation first. Then we started working on CSS through some popular frameworks like bootstrap and materialize.
